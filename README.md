Using Tensorflow and Keras module to build models such as: Recurrent Neural Network, Bayesian Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, K-Nearest Neighbors.
Using Holt-Winter's Exponential Smoothing method with statsmodels library.
All of results are compared by Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error methods.
